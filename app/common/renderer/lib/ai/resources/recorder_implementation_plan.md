## Key Priorities for Initial Implementation

1. **Modular Recorder Listener** - The highest priority is implementing a clean, modular listener architecture that can be tested independently with simple logging
2. **Core Data Structures** - Define clean interfaces for the data that will flow through the system
3. **Basic Capture Functionality** - Implement screenshot and source capture with minimal processing
4. **Simple UI Controls** - Create basic recording controls before advanced features
5. **Comprehensive Logging** - Ensure all actions and events are thoroughly logged for debugging

## Testing Strategy

The testing strategy emphasizes early verification of the recorder listener through logging:

1. **Initial Phase** - Focus on verifying that all events are properly intercepted and logged
2. **Listener Validation** - Create tests that simulate Appium events and verify appropriate logging
3. **Data Integrity** - Test that captured data is properly stored and retrievable
4. **UI Functionality** - Verify that UI controls properly interact with the recording system
5. **Integration Testing** - Ensure recorder components integrate properly with Appium Inspector

By structuring the implementation to focus on the modular recorder listener first with comprehensive logging, the team can validate the core functionality early in the development process before building more complex features on top.

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a detailed roadmap for developing the recording module with an emphasis on modularity, testability, and a clean separation of concerns. By starting with a well-designed recorder listener that implements thorough logging, the team can validate the core functionality early and build on a solid foundation. The sequential task breakdown allows for incremental development and testing, reducing the risk of integration issues later in the project.
