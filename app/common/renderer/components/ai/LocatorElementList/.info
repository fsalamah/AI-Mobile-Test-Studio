LocatorElementList
This guide will walk you through integrating the refactored LocatorElementList component into your existing application while maintaining complete compatibility.
Installation Steps
1. Create Component Directory Structure
Create a new directory structure for the refactored components:
src/
└── components/
    └── LocatorElementList/
        ├── index.js                 # Main export file
        ├── LocatorElementList.jsx   # Main component
        ├── ElementListHeader.jsx    # Header component
        ├── ElementsGroup.jsx        # State grouping component
        ├── ElementCard.jsx          # Individual element card
        ├── ElementFormModal.jsx     # Add/edit modal
        └── elementUtils.js          # Utility functions
2. Copy Component Files
Copy all the component files into their respective locations in the new directory structure.
3. Verify Imports in Your App
Ensure your application imports the component from the correct location. If you were previously using:
javascriptimport { LocatorElementList } from './path/to/LocatorElementList';
You should continue using the same import statement. The index.js file will handle redirecting to the new component structure.
4. Test the Integration
After integrating the refactored components, test your application to ensure everything works as expected:

Verify element listing functionality
Test element editing
Confirm search functionality
Validate XPath evaluation
Check all event handlers and callbacks

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during integration:
Issue: Component not found

Check the export in index.js
Verify the import path in your application

Issue: Event handlers not working

Ensure all prop names match the original component
Check that event handler functions have the same signatures

Issue: Styling differences

Review the styling props in all components
Make sure all Ant Design components are properly configured

Issue: XPath evaluation not working

Verify the evaluateXPath function is being passed correctly
Check that the XPath state management is functioning

Advanced: Using Individual Components
If you wish to use the individual components in other parts of your application:

Uncomment the additional exports in index.js
Import the specific components:
javascriptimport { ElementCard } from './components/LocatorElementList';


This allows you to reuse parts of the refactored component structure while maintaining the compatibility of the main component.
